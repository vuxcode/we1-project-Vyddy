# Project Summary

It's been a joy (and a pain but mostly a joy) to work on this project and I'm very happy with the final results. In the end i spent about 30 hours of documented time (maybe a few more undocumented) which is under budget and I feel like that's noticeable in the webdesign part where I spent less of my time. But in spite of poor (although personally it's above average) time management I feel as if my work has been effective and goal-oriented and the final submission is very close to how I envisioned it. Thinking back on my work I'm honestly quite impressed with myself in both pushing myself to try new ways to solve issues but also in recognizing my limits and keeping it simple. This project has been a good balance of both I think.

Things I would've done differently:
- Using box-sizing from the start would've saved some time and made the CSS way more easily organised.
- Organised my CSS before I started writing it. Although I had a sketch a more detailed one would've helped me stay focused. However I didn't know how to solve a lot of the issues before they showed up so the plan wouldn't have been complete but a good step either way.
- Made more CSS before starting the program. I think i rushed a bit knowing that the script would need the most time and so I rushed the CSS until it was "good enough" as a base for the script. When I then returned to the webdesign after finishing the program I'd lost the workflow and logic.

What I'm most proud of:
- I'm honestly quite astonished with how well I managed to organize the code. I love being organized and optimized so the "pages"-array structure was amazing to get functional and I'm so pleased with it!

Hopefully I can keep updating this project so here are some future improvements:
- Fix the "report-bug" button. Open a form where information can be filled out and sent to me with details of said-encountered bug.
- Add music. I really think this would add a lot of immersion and I'm sad I didn't have time to incorporate it.
- Maybe remove the "logo" on the gamepage in favour of a cool background image. This would help making the game fit on screen all at the same time as well.
- Fill out the "about me" info...
- Add more pictures. My initial plan was to have a picture for each of the endings rather than just text. This one might take a while though...
- redo the nav-bar. The buttons aren't the same size (maybe box-sizing is a quick fix for this one) and I'd prefer for the nav-bar to be connected to the body rather than the left side of the page.
